Enhance is an AI-powered image enhancement tool that lets you upscale and improve image quality directly in your browser. Try it out at [enhance.addy.ie](https://enhance.addy.ie)

## Features

- üñºÔ∏è **Multiple Enhancement Models**:
  - ESRGAN models for upscaling (2x, 3x, 4x, 8x)
  - MAXIM models for specific enhancements:
    - Deblurring
    - Denoising
    - Low-light enhancement
    - Photo retouching
    - Rain removal
    - Indoor dehazing

- üéØ **Smart Image Processing**:
  - Automatic image size optimization
  - WebGL-aware processing
  - Efficient patch-based processing
  - Progress tracking

- üé® **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Drag-and-drop image upload
  - Real-time image preview
  - Interactive size adjustment
  - Aspect ratio lock/unlock
  - One-click download

## Technical Details

### Models

- **ESRGAN Models**:
  - Slim (2.5MB): Fast, lightweight model for general use
  - Medium (5MB): Balanced performance and quality
  - Thick (12MB): High-quality upscaling with better detail preservation
  - Default (2MB): Standard upscaling model

- **MAXIM Models** (8MB each):
  - Specialized models for specific image enhancement tasks
  - Optimized for 64x64 patches
  - Automatic input size adjustment

### Implementation

- Built with React and TypeScript
- Uses TensorFlow.js for model inference
- WebGL acceleration for processing
- Efficient memory management
- Progressive enhancement support
